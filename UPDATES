UPDATES:


29.07.20

The Python script for Apollo Reward tracking has been updated, from now on rewards are not tracked as whole-number-integers, but as more detailed floats.
The AMB price is now pulled from Coingecko which makes it easy to choose any currency that rewards should be tracked in.
The code and description has been updated in the code-snippets and the Wiki install tutorial. 
To update, you simply overwrite the content of your get_apollo_rewards.py and change your user folder and apollo node-settings as in your old version.

The Reward to calendar mac tracking tool is no longer maintained, as its not as useful as the python solution.

27.07.20

Version 2.6 uploaded and code snippets updated.
- EUR Price ticker and EUR reward estimation are pulling their data from the free Coingecko API from now on.
- Additionally this API is much more user friendly than CMC and 
- you can simply exchange EUR with your currency in the API link (see updated code), no registration at Coingecko needed.

15.07.20

Version 2.5 AMB API change and a little fix for the Coinmarketcap API Data handling for EUR or other currency price ticker has been added and 
updated in Reward-Estimate Code snippets and EUR Price ticker.
- I'm getting really annoyed how often Coinmarketcap changes their API these days. Thinking about switching to coingecko ...
- There has been some change in the AMB API/how Values like Supply are given. Reward estimate scripts have been fixed accordingly.

01.07.20

Version 2.4 uploaded with Coinmarketcap API Data handling corrected, new Ambernomics included into reward estimates,
Atlas detailed data pull error for rewards estimates fixed and code snippets updated.
- Adjustments happened in EUR Price ticker and EUR Reward estimation to work again for Coinmarketcap setup.
- The new Ambernomics of 50% of bundlereward going in a 70/30% split to Atlas and Apollo and 50% of Blockreward of 10% inflation going to Apollo has been added.
- Numbers of each Atlas type, which are pulled from amb.money have not been read out correctly before.

26.06.20

Added "get_rewards_python.py" script and installation tutorial in the wiki named "track_daily_apollo_rewards".
This allows apollo node operators to automatically track their daily node rewards for up to 6 nodes through a cronjob on their node into a rewards.csv file.
I wrote this in the first place, because I wanted to go on vacation without having to take my laptop and execute a calendar event everyday to track noderewards.
Then added more nodeslots to make it universally usable.

24.04.20

Version 2.3 uploaded with Coinmarketcap API Data handling corrected and code snippets updated
- The Coinmarketcap API has changed, this update just affects setups that don't use Ambrosus API pulled USD Data.
- Adjustments happened in EUR Price ticker and EUR Reward estimation

12.04.20

Version 2.2 uploaded with reward estimation corrected and code snippets updated
- as price has been calculated only for 2 decimals after comma resulting in 0 at the moment, this now is fixed.
- a tiny variable bug for reward estimation has been fixed aswell.
- link to amb-net Stats page has been added when you tap on the price ticker.

04.01.20

Version 2.1 (again no functional update, just code cleanup)
- Cleaned up the code of the Multiple Atlas and Multiple Apollo Main Stats a little more 
  for readability and maybe processing speed. The Code Snippets have been updated accordingly.

08.11.19

Reuploaded Version 2.0 and Reward_to_csv_Calendar-Automation Tool with much cleaner code (no functional update)
- Made noticeable code simplifications mainly to Multiple Atlas, Multiple Apollo and Reward_to_csv_Calendar-Automation. 
- Updated the much shorter code to the Code-Snippets aswell. This should provide better readability and overview.
- The old Version of the Dashboard with the longer code is still downloadable in the Old-Versions folder.

29.10.19

Reward_to_csv_Calendar-Automation Tool Bugfix
- In the first Version the old balance in the buffer file was not overwritten. 
  This has been fixed now and should work as expected.

26.10.19

Reward_to_csv_Calendar-Automation Tool 
- This is just a temporary rough tool to write your Noderewards down automatically, 
  until we have access to detailed AMB-net data from the past.
- Added as zipped Automator file that can be converted to a Mac Calendar event, where you can set time and daily automatic execution. 
  (Once the Calendar message pops up on your mac, the script executes)
- It writes balance today - balance yesterday to a csv file with date and time from the second day you run it. 
- It checks, if data for the day has already been written to the file and doesnt do it a second time. 
- If there are no rewards that day, nothing is written to the csv.
- Always check the results, as API or other variables may change. But normally the script throws an error.

19.10.19

Version 2.0 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Corrected API Readings to new Explorer settings.
- Added Reward Estimation that is able to combine Node rewards even for different Node types and added code snippets.
- Adjusted Explorer links back to explorer.ambrosus.com.
- Added Link to Amb.Money when tapping on the Reward section. Thanks Roman for helping me out on reward calculation.
- Updated README with new Text and images according to the new features.

22.09.19

Version 1.6 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Changed update-nop command to "sudo ./update.sh" instead of "sudo sh /update.sh"
- Adjusted explorer links to explorer-new.ambrosus.com
- Changed resync command to pull blockchain image for faster resync.
- Adjusted coinmarketcap priceticker to give correct results (api output changed 1 line)
- Added run diagnostics button (not working from user) and added code snippet.
- Added ~/ in front of ambrosus-nop in all scripts to have the scripts work from all folders.

26.08.19

Version 1.5 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Added new Stats Dashboard options for multiple Atlas or Apollo setups with numbered dots showing online status in 
  green/red and metrics adding up nodes balances, stakes and sheltered bundles into a comfortable overview.
- Updated Github repository README accordingly to make setup easier.
- Uploaded new code Snippets for multiple node setups and the Atlas payout function, which was missing before.

21.08.19

Version 1.3 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Simplified how logs are pulled (no docker container id needed).
- Added Atlas Payout button to node control dashboard.
- If Apollo node is not found in the API it is showing as OFFLINE.
- Added corrected description for Apollo Main Stats.
- Corrected EUR AMB ticker to 1 decimal after comma in the change variable, same as USD ticker.

10.08.19:

Version 1.2 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Changed the way Apollos pull state, status and blocks to work on any state history length of the node. 
  Additionally the code was cleaned up.
- Changed the way Atlases determine Online status. If node is not found in the API,
  it's shown as offline instead of getting cryptic text returns.
- Added Resync Chain button to the node control.
- Added more multiple node templates for logging in and showing node logs 
  according to the colored backgrounds I made before (6 + 1 test). 
  So people with any number of nodes have a good base to start from.     

09.08.19:

Version 1.1 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Changed the way Apollos pull validated blocks 
  as this info could not be pulled on nodes that have more node states 
  (offline, online history on the blockchain).
