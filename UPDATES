UPDATES:

Version 1.2 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Changed the way Apollos pull state, status and blocks to work on any state history length of the node. 
- Changed the way Atlases determine Online status. If node is not found in the API,
  it's shown as offline instead of getting cryptic text returns.
- Added Resync Chain button to the node control.
- Added more multiple node templates for logging in and showing node logs 
  according to the colored backgrounds I made before (6 + 1 test). 
  So people with any number of nodes have a good base to start from.

Version 1.1 uploaded and code snippets updated
- Changed the way Apollos pull validated blocks 
  as this info could not be pulled on nodes that have more node states 
  (offline, online history on the blockchain).
