# AMB-NET-Touchbar-Dashboard
A Macbook Touchbar Dashboard created for easily monitoring and controlling your 
ATLAS or APOLLO Node on AMB-Net through BetterTouchTool.

Hello fellow AMB-Net node operator. Welcome to this little repository.
Here I present a complete setup that may help you monitor and control your ATLAS or APOLLO through a MacBook Touchbar.

Please note that this is NOT an official tool created by Ambrosus, but a set that I built to control my own node and found quite useful to share with the whole community. 
Although I don't expect any dangerous errors, I give no warranty that this is bug-free, so please look at the code, before executing. 

Also note that as soon as the Ambrosus-API is altered in any way, the pulled node info might not work as expected anymore and changes to the code may be needed. Thats why I'm posting all the code snippets in here seperately aswell.

So let's get started. My setup only works with a tool called BetterTouchTool, which you can purchase here for 7,5 USD for a 2 year license:

Luckily this is the only thing that needs to be bought if you are already own a MacBook with Touchbar. A long time I have wondered if it was really worth to get the more expensive MacBook with Touchbar. But now it has gotten really useful for operating my node on AMB-Net.


After you have purchased your BetterTouchTool license and installed the software, 
just open it and import the newest AMB-DASHBOARD*.bbtpreset file that I have put up here for download by using the preset Function in the to left corner.
