-- this script shows ips blocked after too many failed login attemps
-- I use fail2ban as bruteforce protection here. 
-- To install, run the following:
-- sudo apt-get install -y fail2ban
-- sudo systemctl start fail2ban
-- sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
-- awk '{ printf "# "; print; }' /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf | sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
-- sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
-- now move down to where it says "max retry", "findtime", "bantime" and DEFAULT above those 3.
-- erase # in all 4 of those lines and adjust settings to your liking.
-- CAUTION setting max retry to 5 for example, typing in your ssh key wrong 5 times causes a ban on your used login ip for set bantime.
-- run to activate your settings: sudo systemctl restart fail2ban

tell application "Terminal"
	set currentTab to do script "sudo zgrep -h \"Ban \" /var/log/fail2ban.log* | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c" in window 1
	
	
end tell
